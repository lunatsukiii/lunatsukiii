## Who am I? 

Hi, I'm Luna, a beginner coder mainly interested in making games.  
  
Pronouns: she/her

Currently I am learning C# by making a 2D puzzle platformer in Unity,
and I am also still learning new things in flutter by working on an App which will hopefuly be released in the next couple of months! 
Right now all of my repos are private though.  

I have a lot of project ideas floating around in my head and I hope to someday be able to execute them!  
Sadly though, right now the only programming language I kind of feel comfortable with, is Dart in the flutter framework,  
I also learned Python once but I never use Python.
Usually I sadly do not have alot of time to code,  
but whenever I start a new project I at least **try** to stick to it.  
I am very open to learning new languages and collaborating as long as I'm interested in the project so feel free to hmu!
