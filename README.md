## Who am I? 

Hi, I'm Luna, an artist and beginner coder, mainly interested in making games, with a big dream to work in the video game industry in the future.  
  
Pronouns: she/her

Currently I am learning C# by making a 3D game in Unity: *Cereal Simulator*!  
I have some experience in Flutter but I still have quite a bit to learn before I would be comfortable saying that I master it.

I have a lot of project ideas floating around in my head and I hope to someday be able to execute them!  
Currently I sadly only know 3 programming languages: Dart in the Flutter Framework, C# in Unity and Python, I don't use Python tho

Usually I do not have alot of time to code,
but whenever I start a new project I **try** to stick to it.  
I am very open to learning new languages and collaborating as long as I'm interested in the project, so feel free to hmu!  

As of right now my programming knowledge is still pretty small, but I'll be giving my best to find time to practice more and someday hopefully form a gamedev team with other people that have similar interests!
