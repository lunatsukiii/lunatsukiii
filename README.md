## Who am I? 

Hi, I'm Luna, a artist and beginner coder, mainly interested in making games, with a big dream to work in the video game industry in the future.  
  
Pronouns: she/her

Currently I am learning C# in Unity!  
I have some experience in Flutter but I still have quite a bit to learn before I would be comfortable saying that I'm good at using it.

I have a lot of project ideas floating around in my head and I hope to someday be able to execute them!  
Sadly though, right now the only programming language I kind of feel comfortable with, is Dart in the flutter framework like I mentioned before.  
I also learned Python once but I never use Python.  

Usually I sadly do not have alot of time to code,
but whenever I start a new project I at least **try** to stick to it.  
I am very open to learning new languages and collaborating as long as I'm interested in the project, so feel free to hmu!  

As of right now my programming knowledge is still pretty small, but I'll be giving my best to find time to practice more and someday hopefully form a gamedev team with other people!
